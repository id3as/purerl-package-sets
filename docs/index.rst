Spacchetti Guide
============================

This is a guide for the Package Set project `Spacchetti <https://github.com/justinwoo/spacchetti>`_, which provides a way to work with package definitions for Psc-Package using the `Dhall <https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-lang>`_ programming language. This guide will also try to guide you through some of the details of how Psc-Package itself works, and some details about the setup of this project and how to use Dhall.

.. note:: If there is a topic you would like more help with that is not in this guide, open a issue in the Github repo for it to request it.
